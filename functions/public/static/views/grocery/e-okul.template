<h1> Project: </h1>
<h2> Electron App: E-Okul Toplu Resim DÃ¼zenleyici </h2>
<h3> Description: </h3>
<p> 
This was my first electronjs project. Simply batch processes all images in a folder to a specific image size and file size.
This is because Education Ministry in Turkey requires a specific image and file size when uploading students' images to their portal.
