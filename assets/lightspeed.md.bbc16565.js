They have services for physical store management and ecom. Their API is also cool, I have interacted with both API&#39;s over the firebase cloud functions and they are solid.</p><p>Their ecom themes use a templating language called twig. Which is kind of better than liquid of Shopify actually because you can create key value storing objects with it unlike liquid. You also have &quot;<a href="https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/tags/macro.html">macros</a>&quot; which act kinda like functions with some limitations. Also you can request all pages data as json when you append json to end of any page.</p><p>Downside of lightspeed, it has a traditional corporate setup when it comes to development. Being a partner does not only mean signing up like in the Shopify. It is unlikely you can get a partner as a single developer. But for the clients, probably you are good to go, their support is just like Shopify.</p><p><span style="display:block;"><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.lightspeedhq.com/pos/retail/ecommerce/" title="Lightspeed Ecom" style="color:unset !important;display:block;min-width:340px;width:90%;"><span style="display:flex;align-items:center;padding:6px 10px 8px 10px;border-radius:8px;border:0.8px solid #dedede;"><img src="https://assets.lightspeedhq.com/img/9046ab39-lightspeed-share-image.jpg" style="margin-right:12px;border-radius:8px;width:50px;height:50px;"><span style=""><span style="-webkit-box-orient:vertical;-webkit-line-clamp:1;line-clamp:1;display:-webkit-box;overflow:hidden;text-overflow:ellipsis;opacity:0.8;font-size:14px;line-height:14px;font-weight:bold;"> eCommerce - Lightspeed </span><span style="-webkit-box-orient:vertical;-webkit-line-clamp:2;line-clamp:2;display:-webkit-box;overflow:hidden;text-overflow:ellipsis;opacity:0.6;margin:4px 0 0 0;font-weight:400;font-size:12px;line-height:12px;"> Lightspeed&amp;#039;s eCommerce platform and online store software will help your business build a strong web presence.
