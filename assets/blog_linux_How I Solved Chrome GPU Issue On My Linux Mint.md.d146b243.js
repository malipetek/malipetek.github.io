I got tired of cinnamon crashing often and chrome devtools was slow too. I was unable to open lets say 6-8 devtools. It would make my system so slow it bothered me. I remember it was better when I was using windows actually.</p><p>First I transitioned to XFCE for desktop environment, hoping it would be better since it is known for its lightweightness.</p><p>Then I went ahead and enabled all hardware acceleration flag in <strong>Chrome</strong>. However there was an issue, <strong>Chrome</strong> would not render when it is maximized or sometimes when I opened a second window with maximization.</p><p>I have MESA drivers on my system so I should be able to use my intel HD4000 ( Ivy Bridge ) GPU for OPENGL.</p><p>First I tought maybe my MESA installation was not correct.</p><p>I tried uninstalling existing libdrm package. It actually removed many other packages, <strong>never do it</strong>.</p><p>Finally I understood issue was this thing called X11, I dont even know what it is exactly. But it is something like a software bridge between lower gpu libraries and your window manager.</p><p>Simply by trial and error and googling everything comes to my mind, I finally found this article.</p><p><a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/06/tuning-intel-graphics-card-ubuntu-16-04/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/06/tuning-intel-graphics-card-ubuntu-16-04/</a></p><p>However file contents was not visible.</p><p>I went to archive.org and found previous version. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191019025026/https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/06/tuning-intel-graphics-card-ubuntu-16-04/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Previous Version</a></p><p>On my system I did not have <code>20-intel.conf</code> in my <code>/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/</code> directory. So I created one:</p><p><code>sudo touch /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf</code></p><p>And I opened the file:</p><p><code>sudo gedit /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf</code></p><p>Pasted content saved and rebooted.</p><div class="language-"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki github-dark" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#e1e4e8;">Section &quot;Device&quot;</span></span>
