I do php but to some extend, I am more like a <strong>traditional</strong> full stack. Which means javascript everywhere. I started writing cloud functions with firebase, then used all kinds of node setups.</p><p>When commanding the back end, only thing I was forced to learn was bash, cuz someone got to setup that virtual server. I was using linux mint with a xfce for 2 years that helped a lot. But now I got an m1 air.</p><p>After working with servers and stuff I now appreciate cloud more and more. No one has time to manage servers and full stack gods are cheering &quot;get shit done&quot;.</p><p>I love using github actions and any services that help with the pipelines because traditional sys admin tasks are like torture for regular human beings imho.</p><p>These are my views on full stack development.</p><h2 id="tl-dr" tabindex="-1">tl;dr <a class="header-anchor" href="#tl-dr" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>I am in &quot;get shit done&quot; mentality in full stack mode.</p><h2 id="get-a-quote" tabindex="-1"><a class="button" href="/quote-request">Get A Quote</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#get-a-quote" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>', 9);
