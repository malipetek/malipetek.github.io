I have had so many interesting projects there, it changed my view on how software should be built.</p><p>First I made a theme customization on a <a href="https://www.lightspeedhq.com/pos/retail/ecommerce/">Lightspeed eCom</a> store. What is one of a kind project, there is no known workflow for proceeding such thing I invented a way to preview changes.</p><p>I have planned and executed a Shopify migration from a platform I never heard of. Manipulated huge amount of data with nodejs and used Shopify to its limit to match source platforms capabilities. Developed a theme starting from from debut and developed a custom app to add extra functionalities. We also didn&#39;t have 2.0 sections back then so custom app was absolutely necessary.</p><p>I am still contracting projects @ <a href="https://truthnyc.com/">TRUTH NYC</a>, if you need a world class design you can <a href="https://truthnyc.com/contact/">get a quote</a> from them and I would be possibly involved if it is Shopify or some front end heavy stuff.</p><h2 id="get-a-quote-from-truth-nyc" tabindex="-1"><a class="button" href="https://truthnyc.com/contact/" target="_blank">Get A Quote from TRUTH NYC</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#get-a-quote-from-truth-nyc" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><h2 id="truth-nyc" tabindex="-1"><span style="display:block;"><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://truthnyc.com/" title="TRUTH NYC #" style="color:unset !important;display:block;min-width:340px;width:90%;"><span style="display:flex;align-items:center;padding:6px 10px 8px 10px;border-radius:8px;border:0.8px solid #dedede;"><img src="https://truthnyc.com/assets/themes/truthnyc/images/favicon.ico" style="margin-right:12px;border-radius:8px;width:50px;height:50px;"><span style=""><span style="-webkit-box-orient:vertical;-webkit-line-clamp:1;line-clamp:1;display:-webkit-box;overflow:hidden;text-overflow:ellipsis;opacity:0.8;font-size:14px;line-height:14px;font-weight:bold;"> TRUTH NYC - From business solutions to all things digital </span><span style="-webkit-box-orient:vertical;-webkit-line-clamp:2;line-clamp:2;display:-webkit-box;overflow:hidden;text-overflow:ellipsis;opacity:0.6;margin:4px 0 0 0;font-weight:400;font-size:12px;line-height:12px;"> . </span></span></span></a></span></h2>',7),r=[n];function s(h,l,c,p,d,u){return e(),a("div",null,r)}const y=t(i,[["render",s]]);export{f as __pageData,y as default};
