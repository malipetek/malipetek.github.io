# Shopify App Development

I did develop 2 public 1 custom Shopify apps from scratch. I touched many aspects of Shopify API like 
- Carrier Service 
- Fullfilment Service 
- Checkout API 
- Payment Provider 
- Graphql Admin
- Rest Admin
- Syncing stores
- Using webhooks
- Embedded UI
- Metafields
- Shopify flow actions

When it comes to app development I ain't your react developer only guy. You can consult me why your app is not working as well. So.

## tl;dr
You app is in good hands.
