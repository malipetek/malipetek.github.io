# Full Stack Development

Full stack development is vague term, some people expect php in the back end and javascript on the front end. I do php but to some extend, I am more like a **traditional** full stack. Which means javascript everywhere. I started writing cloud functions with firebase, then used all kinds of node setups. 

When commanding the back end, only thing I was forced to learn was bash, cuz someone got to setup that virtual server. I was using linux mint with a xfce for 2 years that helped a lot. But now I got an m1 air.

After working with servers and stuff I now appreciate cloud more and more. No one has time to manage servers and full stack gods are cheering "get shit done".

I love using github actions and any services that help with the pipelines because traditional sys admin tasks are like torture for regular human beings imho.

These are my views on full stack development.

## tl;dr
I am in "get shit done" mentality in full stack mode.
