# Shopify Theme Development

We all know nowadays theme development for Shopify means modifying the looks of the Dawn theme. Adding a few of special sections when necessary. Or sometimes it might mean setting up the store with configurations, app installs and metafield definitions.

I have had quite a bit of theme development experience as a front end developer. End of the day we are dealing with a web site that has a particular setup in the back end.

I am happy to attempt anything with your Shopify theme as long as you have the budget and a solid goal. I will come up with a plan for you or tell you it is no brainer if it is over complicated for the platform.

## tl;dr
That theme will work better than you expect.
