# Shopify Theme Maintenance

We can also call this Shopify store maintenance. Thankfully we don't manage our back end with Shopify. So there is no need to regularly upgrade back end modules to stay away from hackers.

Common tasks that go into store maintenance are these:
- Updating theme if it has new versions.
- Fixing issues related to theme config. (Explaining why theme editor does not give expected results)
- Fixing app related issues. (Sometimes apps do things that affect performance of the store or even worse break it)
- Writing up new sections for using on any page not thanks to Shopify 2.0 themes.

It is also essential and there is no reason not to use [github integration](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/tools/github) imho. Because if you use github integration developers also can see what config changes you made through [the theme editor](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/customizing-themes/edit) and roll back if something is broken at any point.

## tl;dr
You theme is in good hands.
