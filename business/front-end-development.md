# Front End Development

Hey, did someone say front end development? I am your ticket to understanding what is going on when you page loads. I am the guy who will explain you why **exactly** your site is slow.

As a full stack developer, I can make your design come to life. I can track where your data is flowing and find out why that nasty container is not sized as expected. 

I should add I am more like in the problem solving and logic implementing side of development so if you want the good looks you better have a design or a design language to implement.

## tl;dr
You can count on me for anything front end.
