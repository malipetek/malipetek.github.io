# Partnership or Full Time Role Offers

## Your App Idea Is Not Good At All
If you have an idea you think that would go big when it gets alive, please keep it to yourself.

> # Execution is everything

If you are believing in execution like me tho, contact me and we can start working on facebook competition together. If you have realistic expectations, I can get you there.

## Full time roles
It is hard to believe but all projects I was involved so far was small to middle sized teams. 

I would consider a full time role if you have a solid team and fully remote opportunity. Your stack does not matter except Angular.
