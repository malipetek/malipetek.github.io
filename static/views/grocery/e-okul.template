<h1> Electron App: E-Okul Toplu Resim DÃ¼zenleyici </h1>

<p> 
This was my first electronjs project. Simply batch processes all images in a folder to a specific image size and file size.
This is because Education Ministry in Turkey requires a specific image and file size when uploading students' images to their portal.
