## How Javascript History API is Used on This Page

When this page loads, it never reloads when you navigate.
However you click links in the header, you will realize (at least on desktop) url is changed. Also when you go back you can actually go back.

Here is how to do it and how it works.

- First we need to add event liteners to all link(`<a>`) elements.

> I preferred adding it to directly each element to ensure we never reload.

- Select `<a>` elements:

```js
var links = container.getElementsByTagName("a");
console.log("asdasd");
```

- `console.log('asdasd')`
- `console.log('asdasd')`
