# Shopify

I met [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) while I was working @ [Customily](customily) and I sticked with it until today. The reason is it is so easy to get started with it and it does not raise corporate barriers for individual developers like me. It makes you feel like anyone with the skills and intention can contribute to it ecosystem. Also its ecosystem is vivid and has many world class clients.

As a front end developer it is weird I started Shopify with app development but it is what it is. Then of course I leaned more to theme development and nowadays it is becoming something else with [2.0 themes(sections everywhere)](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/architecture/sections), [dawn theme](https://themes.shopify.com/themes/dawn/styles/default) and [hydrogen](https://hydrogen.shopify.dev/). Also IE is dead which means we can now ship modern features to browsers more confidently than ever.

Until now I have had experience with many aspects of Shopify except a headless build. Published a public app and failed, modified checkout to apply discounts, wrote background services to clone stores routinely.

Now I am trying to develop and promote [Liquivelte](https://liquivelte.js.org) which is a opinionated way to write Shopify theme code other than helping you with your store.
