## What I do?

I do develop mostly Shopify themes/apps nowadays. But I like anything with JS really. React? fine, Vue? cool, Svelte? fantastic, jQuery? ðŸ˜³ let's go. Nodejs? your computer is mine now.

If you are a Shopify theme developer, I am developing a tool. I would love you to give it a try.

[Liquivelte](@:https://liquivelte.js.org/)

## What is my level?
I require zero(0) babysitting.
::: details Wut this means?

I don't get intimidated by complexity of any project. If something does not do what I expect, I go into logs or source codes of packages or chromium google groups. Where ever it takes.

I do develop anything related to front end. I write javascript like it is my mother tongue. I did work with all kinds of environments from legacy content management systems that would require char escaping to cloud functions that would require fiddling with configuration for days.

If project is cool, I do whatever it takes to crush it. If it is regular work, I just add a bit extra care to feel good about my craft later on.
