## What I do?

I do develop mostly Shopify themes/apps nowadays. But I like anything with JS really. React? fine, Vue? cool, Svelte? fantastic, jQuery? ðŸ˜³ let's go. Nodejs? your computer is mine now.

If you are a Shopify theme developer, I am developing a tool. I would love you to give it a try.

[Liquivelte](@:https://liquivelte.js.org/)

## What is my level?
I require zero(0) babysitting.
::: details Wut this means?

As a senior-level developer, I possess a wealth of experience and a deep understanding of complex projects. I approach challenges with confidence, undeterred by any level of complexity. In the event of unexpected issues, I draw on my extensive knowledge of source code and logs, as well as consult relevant forums and communities, such as Chromium Google Groups. My unwavering dedication to finding solutions ensures that projects are completed to the highest standard possible.

I do develop anything related to front end. I write javascript like it is my mother tongue. I did work with all kinds of environments from legacy content management systems that would require char escaping to cloud functions that would require fiddling with configuration for days.

If project is cool, I do whatever it takes to crush it. If it is regular work, I just add a bit extra care to feel good about my craft later on.
