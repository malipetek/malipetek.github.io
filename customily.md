# Customily

[Customily](https://www.customily.com/) is a SaaS for having dynamic previews for personalized products. I got my first and last full time remote position here and worked there for 2 years.

It was kind of a startup back then so we just shipped anything and everything. I tried almost any tech stack I wanted. Shopify integration with Vue + MSSQL + Win Server, Bigcommerce integration with Vue + Firebase + Firestore, Woocommerce integration with php + vanilla on front end and Vue in the admin.

I mainly worked on integrations but I was there because I knew Fabricjs. I knew [Fabricjs](fabricjs.com) because I was building [an online image editor](https://caps.ninja/capsyap) before.
