# Lightspeed eCom

[Lightspeed eCom](https://www.lightspeedhq.com/pos/retail/ecommerce/) is an interesting platform. They have services for physical store management and ecom. Their API is also cool, I have interacted with both API's over the firebase cloud functions and they are solid.

Their ecom themes use a templating language called twig. Which is kind of better than liquid of Shopify actually because you can create key value storing objects with it unlike liquid. You also have "[macros](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/tags/macro.html)" which act kinda like functions with some limitations. Also you can request all pages data as json when you append json to end of any page.

Downside of lightspeed, it has a traditional corporate setup when it comes to development. Being a partner does not only mean signing up like in the Shopify. It is unlikely you can get a partner as a single developer. But for the clients, probably you are good to go, their support is just like Shopify.
