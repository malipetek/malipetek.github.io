[TRUTH NYC](https://truthnyc.com/) is a creative agency that has all kinds of big projects. I have had so many interesting projects there, it changed my view on how software should be built.

First I made a theme customization on a [Lightspeed eCom](https://www.lightspeedhq.com/pos/retail/ecommerce/) store. What is one of a kind project, there is no known workflow for proceeding such thing I invented a way to preview changes.

I have planned and executed a Shopify migration from a platform I never heard of. Manipulated huge amount of data with nodejs and used Shopify to its limit to match source platforms capabilities. Developed a theme starting from from debut and developed a custom app to add extra functionalities. We also didn't have 2.0 sections back then so custom app was absolutely necessary.

I am still contracting projects @ [TRUTH NYC](https://truthnyc.com/), if you need a world class design you can [get a quote](https://truthnyc.com/contact/) from them and I would be possibly involved if it is Shopify or some front end heavy stuff.
